## Living Styleguide // Pattern Library


---
> A living style guide offers improved documentation of the visual appearance and behavior of a site.
  Unlike a static style guide (say, a wiki page or PDF), it is generated on-the-fly from the actual HTML, CSS, and JavaScript used in production. This allows us to view styles as they are live on the site, and inline comments can be added to document the purpose of a particular style or set of styles.
